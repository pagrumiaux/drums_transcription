# drums_transcription

This repository contains the work I've done during an internship at IRCAM in 2018. The goal of the internship was to create a CRNN for drums transcription, along with the teacher-student paradigm.  
You can find the report of this internship [here](http://www.atiam.ircam.fr/Archives/Stages1718/GRUMIAUX_Pierre-Amaury_Memoire_Stage.pdf) (it's in French though)

Note that the datasets are not integrated in this repository for obvious reasons.

The code is not particularly well commented, so feel free to reach me for any questions.
